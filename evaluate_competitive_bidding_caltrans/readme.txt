The dataset I use in this project consists of bidding activity on project materials for projects associated with the Caltrans network. We will be interested in examining the bidding behavior of firms which bid for Caltrans projects. Caltrans’ system for allocating projects consists of putting out a call for bids for a project and also providing an estimate from the engineering department as to how much the project will cost. Firms then assess the project specifications and submit a bid for their price to fulfill on the project materials. Caltrans awards the firm with the lowest bid as the winner of the bid and they supply the project materials. There may be differences in the final amount paid to the firm relative to the bid depending on circumstances around the project itself. 

Something we might be concerned about in this auction system is whether there is some strategic bidding practice among firms instead of a competitive bidding equilibrium. For instance, if certain firms are knowledgable that the true volume of supplying for a project is higher than the engineering estimate for materials in volume, then they may elect to submit a lower bid than rivals to secure the contract but in fact garner higher profits. This would be accomplished by submitting a lower unit cost to supply for the project than rivals, thus winning the bid, but due to an actual realization of a higher number of units their profits are higher. Profits are given by π = (p − c) ∗ q, so with a lower p, a firm can still get good profits by raising q by using this strategic bidding. We investigate this in the project.
