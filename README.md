# sample_projects
Sample projects for displaying programming and data science skills. I recommend viewing the Tinder or Uber Skills Test results for a Business Analyst role.

## evaluate_competitive_bidding_caltrans
This project uses Caltrans project data to evaluate whether there may be non-competitive bidding behavior in the auction for Caltrans projects. The analysis is done in R. 

## predicting_house_prices_taiwan
This project was from a midterm assignment in the Harvard Statistical Learning course that uses a dataset with sale prices from houses sold in the New Taipei City area of Taiwan. The goal of the assignment was the develop and cross-validate a linear regression model for predicting these housing prices. The analysis is done in R. 

## predoctoral_labor_market
This is a project intended to pull out some basic information from text documents advertising "predoctoral" research assistant positions in economics. The goal of the project was to get some quantitative context for qualitatively valuable skills in this labor market. The analysis was done in Python with a Jupyter Notebook.

## uber_skills_test
This project is a response to Uber’s Skills Test for a Data Scientist position with their Research and Economics: Special Projects team. The ask was to model the long term trend of the login data and to describe and discuss any other insights from the data. The analysis was done in R.

## tinder_skills_test
This project is a response to Tinder’s Skills Test for a Data Science position at the company. The provided dataset includes information on user data on the app including demographic information as well as several features about their interactions on the app like the number of swipes sent, the number of like received, etc. The prompt asks to “to explore, analyze, and tell a story using the attached data.” My analysis examines the effect of age and gender on the experience of users on the app. The analysis was done in R.

## whosin_mockups
WhosIn was a startup project I worked on designed to solve the coordinating frictions associated with planning events with friends. The screenshots here are mockups that represent the assets and core app features at the time of launch. I built the app using Swift in Xcode during 2016-2017 and placed it on the iOS App Store. The design and coding are my original work.
