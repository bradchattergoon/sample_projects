This project involved examining several advertisements for “Economics Pre-Doctoral Fellowships”, typically a 2-year research assistant position with an Economics Professors to gain research experience. During July 2020 these positions came to be common knowledge among many economics professors and was discussed at length on Twitter among economics academics. This brief analysis was meant to quantify some of the interesting elements of the advertisements for getting a quantitative sense of some of the features of what is asked for in the market for these positions.

The file "pre-doc_analysis.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook with the analysis which will load on GitHub.
